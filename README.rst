Kytos - python-openflow (legacy - Python < 3.6)
=======================

Overview
--------

This repo holds an older version of the python-openflow library.

This version will work with Python versions < 3.6. However, it is very out of date and probably full of bugs.

I am not affiliated with the original developers and will only be maintaining this repo for my own projects.
