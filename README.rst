Kytos - python-openflow (legacy - Python < 3.6)
=======================

|Openflow| |Tag| |Release| |Tests| |License|

Overview
--------

This repo holds an older version of the python-openflow library found here: https://github.com/kytos/python-openflow

This version will work with Python versions < 3.6. However, it is very out of date and probably full of bugs.

I am not affiliated with the original developers and will only be maintaining this repo for my own projects.

-------- 

*python-openflow* is a low level library to parse OpenFlow messages. If you want
to read an OpenFlow packet from an open socket or send a message to an OpenFlow
switch, this is your best friend. The main features are: high performance,
latest specification compliance, short learning curve and free software license.

This library is part of `Kytos <http://kytos.io>`_ project, a collaborative
project between SPRACE (from SÃ£o Paulo State University, Unesp) and Caltech
(California Institute of Technology). *python-openflow*  was developed to be
used with *Kytos* controller, but feel free to use this simple and intuitive
library in another project with another controller.

--------

This is just an overview for you to check whether this project fits your needs.
For a more detailed documentation, please check the `python-openflow API
Reference Manual <http://docs.kytos.io/python-openflow/api-reference/>`_.

Usage
^^^^^

For example, see how it is easy to create a feature request message with this
library. You can use ipython3 to get the advantages of autocompletion:

.. The code in this section is replicated in docs/toc/usage.rst.

>>> from pyof.v0x01.controller2switch.features_request import FeaturesRequest
>>> request = FeaturesRequest(xid = 100)
>>> print(request.header.message_type)
Type.OFPT_FEATURES_REQUEST
>>> print(request.header.xid)
100

If you need to send this message via socket, call the ``pack()`` method to get
its binary representation:

.. code:: python

    >>> binary_msg = request.pack()

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can install this package with pip package installer or from source code.

=====================
Installing from PyPI
=====================

*python-openflow* is in PyPI, so you can easily install it via `pip3` (`pip`
for Python 3) and also include this project in your `requirements.txt`

If you do not have `pip3` you can install it on Ubuntu-base machines by running:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ sudo add-apt-repository universe
    $ sudo apt update
    $ sudo apt install python3-pip

Once you have `pip3`, execute:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ sudo pip3 install python-openflow

=======================
Installing source code
=======================

First you need to clone `python-openflow` repository:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ git clone https://github.com/kytos/python-openflow.git


After cloning, the installation process is done by `setuptools` in the usual
way:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ cd python-openflow
   $ sudo python3 setup.py install

=====================
Checking installation
=====================

That's it! To check wether it is installed successfully, please try to import
after running ``python3`` or ``ipython3``:

.. code-block:: python3

   >>> import pyof
   >>> # no errors should be displayed
